This C++ project provides a class, Quadratic, designed to handle quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c. 
The class supports addition of quadratic equations, calculation of roots, vertex, derivative, and definite integral
over an interval. Additionally, it can compare the areas under two quadratic curves over a given interval to determine 
which one is larger.
